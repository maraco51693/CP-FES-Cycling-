Cadence control

takes two inputs:
throttle_%
vel_rpm

if (throttle_% >= 40)
 pass cad_ref , a constant value = 30
else 
approximate the throttle_%, upper bounded by 30
label this val as cad_ref

vel_rpm = cad

Multiple every element in cad_ref and cad by 6

perform a discrete filter on cad_ref using the values in t_mat as numerator
perform a discrete filter on cad using the values in s_mat as a numerator

Sum1 = cad_ref - cad

LOOP {
Sum2 = Sum1 + discrete filter (sum(2))
Sum2 = discrete filter(sum2, denominator phio_mat)
Bound Sum2 by  1 }
Delay by 1/ts (ts = 20)

return as Vm_ref

Vmotor = element wise matrix multiplication Vm_ref.* 5
